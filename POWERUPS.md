# Powerups

Powerups are rated as D,C,B,A, or S. The better grade, the more expensive the powerup.

### ArrowRate

- Grade: C
- Increases the spawn rate of the arrows firing from the tower.

### CircleSpeed

- Grade: D
- Increases the speed of the player-controlled circles.

### DarkBlast

- Grade: B
- Fires projectiles from the tower in a clockwise direction. Leveling up makes the cooldown and angle difference smaller.

### Regen

- Grade: D
- Heals the tower occasionally. Leveling up makes the regen occur more frequently.

### TimeSlow

- Grade: S
- Slows then stops all enemies on the map, then happens again very occasionally. Leveling up does the effect again, and makes the cooldown lower so it will be more frequent in the future.

### Tornado

- Grade: C
- Creates a tornado somewhere random on the map that moves around slightly. Each level creates a new one.
