# RandomTower

A small hobby. Making a tower survival game with TypeScript, Preact, and Phaser.JS.

I'm not following any designs, but I'm doing small refactors each time I work on it.

## Current State

Enemies spawn in increasing numbers

Enemies are destroyed by the player's circle weapon or the tower's automatic arrow or powerup attacks.

There are currently 6 powerups in the game. Try them out by pressing Q W E when you have enough gold.

## Controls

Enter/Space - Start the game

Q W E - Buy items

Up Down Left Right - Move the circle weapon

U - Dev command for 1000 gold

K - Dev command to increase enemy spawn speed by 1 per second.
