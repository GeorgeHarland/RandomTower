# RandomTower

A small hobby. Making an idle(ish) tower game with TypeScript, Preact, and Phaser.JS.

Code is messy. I'm not following any designs, but I'm doing small refactors each time I work on it.

## Current State

Enemies spawn in increasing numbers

Enemies are destroyed by the tower's automatic arrows, or the player's big circle weapon.

You can buy powerups, but these do nothing yet.

## Controls

Enter/Space - Start the game

Q W E - Buy items

Up Down Left Right - Move the orb

U - Dev command for 1000 gold

K - Dev command to increase enemy spawn speed by 1 per second.
