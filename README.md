# RandomTower

A small hobby. Making a tower survival game with TypeScript, Preact, and Phaser.JS.

Open to contributions and opinions! I'll add more issues over time.

## Description

Enemies spawn in increasing numbers. Slower enemies that can take more hits spawn after a while.

Enemies are destroyed by the player's circle weapon (arrow keys) or the tower's automatic arrow or powerup attacks.

There are currently 8 powerups in the game. Press Q, W, E after getting some gold to try them out!

Powerups get more expensive each purchase, by 1 gold + the amount of minutes played.
