# RandomTower

A small hobby. Making a tower survival game with TypeScript, Preact, and Phaser.JS.

## Description

Enemies spawn in increasing numbers. Slower enemies that can take more hits spawn after a while.

Enemies are destroyed by the player's circle weapon (arrow keys) or the tower's automatic arrow or powerup attacks.

The bigger enemies can be pushed back, so try to use the circle weapon against those.

There are currently 7 powerups in the game. Press Q, W, E after getting some gold to try them out!

Powerups get more expensive each purchase, by 1 gold + the amount of minutes played.

## Controls

Enter/Space - Start the game

Q W E - Buy items

Up Down Left Right - Move the circle weapon

U - Dev command for 1000 gold

K - Dev command to increase enemy spawn speed by 1 per second.
